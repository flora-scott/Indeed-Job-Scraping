## General Assembly Project 4 - Predicting salaries of data scientists by scraping Indeed.com
This project was part of the General Assembly immersive data science course and aimed to predict high vs low salaries of data scientists in the US by building a classification model. To achieve this, I utilized web scraping techniques to collect data from Indeed.com, a popular job search platform, and employed techniques such as regex to clean and process the data. Natural language processing (NLP) was then used to identify the most common words and phrases that were likely to indicate a high salary in the data science field. The project not only helped improve web scraping skills but also enhanced proficiency in NLP and classification modeling. Overall, this project provided valuable hands-on experience in building a machine learning model for predicting salaries based on job descriptions and helped develop a range of data science skills.
